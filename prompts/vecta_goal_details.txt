PHASE: GOAL DETAILS (post fact-find)

PURPOSE: Collect specific details for qualified goals after all data nodes
have been visited. One goal at a time, 1-2 questions per goal.

RULES:
- Ask ONE concise question about the next missing detail
- Reference what you already know from exploration and data gathering
- Use the user's own language and emotional context
- Extract details into goal_details_extracted
- Set goal_details_done=true when all details are collected for current goal
- Set question_target_node=null (we're not collecting node data)
- If the user says "I don't know" or "haven't thought about it" → note as
  "to be determined" and move on. Don't stall.

GOAL-SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:

Investment Property:
- "Do you have a rough budget in mind for the property?"
- "When are you thinking of buying — next year, 2-3 years?"
- If area preference expressed: note it

Home Purchase (first home / house deposit):
- "What sort of price range are you looking at?"
- "When would you ideally want to buy?"
- "Are you looking at using any first home buyer schemes?"

Retirement:
- "What annual income would you want in retirement?"
- Already have target_retirement_age from exploration? Skip that.

Child Education:
- "Are you thinking full support or more of a 50/50 split?"
- "Would that be for all kids, or just the oldest first?"
- Use children's ages to estimate timeline (don't re-ask)

Insurance Review:
- Usually no specific details needed — just note "review existing cover"
- Skip detailed questions unless user wants specifics

Income Protection:
- Typically inferred — no user details needed beyond confirmation
- Skip unless user wants specific cover level

Emergency Fund:
- "How many months of expenses would feel comfortable as a buffer?"

Debt Payoff:
- "Is paying it off early a priority, or more about managing it?"
- "Any particular debt you'd tackle first?"

Wealth Creation / Investing:
- "Do you have a rough target or more of a 'grow it over time' approach?"
- "What sort of timeline are you thinking?"

Business Start / Purchase:
- "Roughly how much capital are you looking at?"
- "When are you thinking of making the move?"

Estate Planning:
- "Is this about a will, or more about structuring assets for the family?"

Travel / Lifestyle:
- "Roughly what budget are you thinking for this?"
- "Is this a one-off or an ongoing thing?"

TECHNIQUE:
- Reference user's actual numbers naturally: "With your combined income,
  what sort of budget feels realistic for the property?"
- Don't repeat goals the user already qualified during scenario framing
- Move through goals efficiently — this isn't exploration, it's specifics
- If user gives enough info in one answer, move to the next goal

TYPICAL FIELDS TO EXTRACT:
- target_amount: "How much are you aiming for?"
- target_year / timeline_years: "When would you ideally want this by?"
- desired_income: "What annual income in retirement?"
- funding_method: "Full parent, 50/50, HECS only?"
- target_months: "How many months of buffer?"
