CONTEXTUAL QUESTION PATTERNS FOR AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL PLANNING
================================================================

This document provides examples of how to ask questions contextually,
referencing what is already known from the conversation. Questions
should feel like a continuation, never a restart.

PERSONAL NODE:
- If age unknown: "How old are you, just so I've got context?"
- If occupation unknown: "What do you do for work? Full-time, part-time, contract?"
- If marital status unknown but no partner mentioned: "And is there a partner or spouse in the picture?"
- NEVER ask "Are you married?" if user mentioned "missus", "wife", "partner", or "husband"

MARRIAGE NODE (only if married):
- "You mentioned your wife — what does she do for work?"
- "Do you know roughly what her annual income is?"
- "Are your finances combined or do you keep things separate?"
- Reference what's known: "With her finance background, you've probably already been bouncing ideas around."

DEPENDENTS NODE:
- If children exist but count unknown: "You mentioned the kids — how many do you have and roughly what ages?"
- If children exist: "Are they at public school, private, or Catholic?"
- If children ages known: "Is your [age]-year-old thinking about uni yet?"
- "Are you supporting anyone else financially — parents or anyone?"
- NEVER ask "Do you have children?" if user mentioned kids, grandkids, son, daughter

INCOME NODE:
- "What's your annual salary?"
- "Do you have any other income besides your main job — rental, dividends, anything like that?"
- Reference spouse: "So household income of about $Xk between the two of you — solid base."

EXPENSES NODE:
- "Roughly what do your monthly expenses look like? The big ones — mortgage, bills, groceries."
- Reference known: "the school fees we already mentioned"
- "Anything else that chews through the budget?"

SAVINGS NODE:
- "How much have you got sitting in savings right now?"
- "Is any of that in an offset account against the mortgage?" (AU-specific)
- Reference: "That leaves a decent chunk from your combined income."

ASSETS NODE:
- "Beyond the cash and your home, what other assets do you and your wife have?"
- Reference known: "You mentioned she's got some shares."
- "What about super balances, any other investments?"

LOAN NODE:
- "What's the outstanding balance on the mortgage?"
- "Do you have any other debts — car loan, credit cards, HECS, anything like that?"
- Reference: "Good work on the credit card discipline."

INSURANCE NODE:
- "You said you've got some insurance through work — do you know what type? Life, income protection, TPD?"
- "Does your wife have cover too?"
- Reference goal context: "Given how important protecting your family is to you..."

RETIREMENT NODE:
- "Do you know who your super fund is with?"
- "Are either of you salary sacrificing any extra into super?"
- Reference: "For that retirement at 60, super's going to be key."

GENERAL PRINCIPLES:
- One question at a time
- Reference what you know before asking what you don't
- Make questions feel connected to goals and values
- Use Australian terminology naturally (super, HECS, offset, etc.)
- Never re-ask something already in the graph
