COMMON AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL GOAL PATTERNS
==========================================

This document describes common goal patterns in Australian financial planning,
how surface goals often mask deeper motivations, and what data points
are typically needed for each goal type.

RETIREMENT:
- Surface: "I want to retire" / "retirement planning"
- Common strategies: Super contributions, investment property, shares
- Key data needed: Current age, target retirement age, super balance, desired income
- Australian context: Preservation age 55-60, Age Pension ~$28k single / ~$42k couple
- ASFA comfortable standard: ~$72k/year couple, ~$51k/year single
- Common underlying needs: Freedom, security, time with family, travel
- Typical timeline: 15-25 years

INVESTMENT PROPERTY:
- Surface: "I want to buy an investment property"
- Often a strategy for: Wealth creation, family security, retirement income
- Key data needed: Budget, timeline, existing property/mortgage, income
- Australian context: Negative gearing, 50% CGT discount, stamp duty varies by state
- Common underlying needs: Financial independence, legacy, security
- Typical timeline: 2-5 years to purchase

CHILD EDUCATION:
- Surface: "Save for kids' education" / "help them through uni"
- Key data needed: Number of children, ages, school type, university plans
- Australian context: HECS/HELP covers tuition, living costs $20-25k/year
- Catholic school ~$5-10k/year, Private ~$15-25k/year, Public minimal
- Common underlying needs: Giving children a better start, breaking cycle
- Typical timeline: Based on child's age to uni entry (~5-15 years)

EMERGENCY FUND:
- Typically inferred, not stated: Low savings relative to expenses
- Australian context: 3-6 months expenses recommended
- Key indicators: Savings < 3 × monthly expenses, no offset account
- Evidence in data: High expenses, low savings, single income household

INCOME PROTECTION:
- Typically inferred: Physical occupation + mortgage + family
- Australian context: Most employer super includes basic cover, often inadequate
- Key indicators: Construction/manual work, large mortgage, dependents
- Often the user doesn't know they lack adequate cover

DEBT REDUCTION:
- Surface: "I want to be debt free" / "pay off the mortgage faster"
- Key data needed: All liabilities, interest rates, repayment schedules
- Australian context: HECS repayment thresholds (~$54k), mortgage offset strategy
- Common underlying needs: Peace of mind, freedom, reducing financial stress

INSURANCE REVIEW:
- Often prompted by: Life event, friend's health scare, feeling of gaps
- Key data needed: Current cover (life, TPD, income protection, health), amounts
- Australian context: Default super cover often inadequate for mortgage + family
- Medicare levy surcharge for high earners without private health

GOAL VS STRATEGY DETECTION:
- "Investment property" → often a strategy for wealth/security/legacy
- "Pay off mortgage" → often a strategy for freedom/security
- "Save more" → strategy for multiple goals (retirement, property, emergency)
- "Get income protection" → strategy for family protection
- When a goal IS a strategy, explore what the real underlying goal is

GOAL INFERENCE TRIGGERS:
- Children aged 10+ with no education savings → child_education
- Physical occupation + no income protection → income_protection
- Savings < 3 months expenses → emergency_fund
- No life insurance + mortgage + dependents → life_insurance
- High income + no salary sacrifice → super_optimization
