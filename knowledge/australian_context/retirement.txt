- Longevity risk: Australians are living longer (average 85 male, 87 female)
- Inflation: costs rise over a 20-30 year retirement
- Healthcare costs increase with age (even with Medicare + private health)
- Aged care costs can be substantial ($300,000-$500,000+ for residential)

Super Drawdown Strategies:
- Bucket strategy: cash (1-2 years), defensive (3-5 years), growth (5+ years)
- Sustainable withdrawal rate: typically 4-5% of initial balance, adjusted for inflation
- Consider part-pension + super drawdown combination
- Review strategy annually based on market conditions and spending

- Preservation age (55-60): earliest super access
- Age 60: tax-free super withdrawals
