AUSTRALIAN INSURANCE - KEY FACTS

Life Insurance:
- Pays lump sum on death or terminal illness diagnosis
- Can be held inside or outside super
- Inside super: premiums paid from concessional contributions (tax-effective)
  but proceeds may be taxed if paid to non-dependants
- Outside super: premiums not tax-deductible for individuals
  but proceeds are tax-free
- Typical cover: 10-15x annual income, enough to clear debts + provide for family

Total and Permanent Disability (TPD):
- Pays lump sum if permanently unable to work
- "Own occupation" vs "any occupation" definitions matter
  Own occupation: can't do YOUR job. Any occupation: can't do ANY job.
- Inside super: usually "any occupation" (cheaper but harder to claim)
- Outside super: "own occupation" available (better coverage)
- Typical cover: similar to life insurance amounts

Income Protection:
- Replaces up to 75% of income if unable to work due to illness/injury
- Waiting period: typically 30, 60, or 90 days
- Benefit period: 2 years, 5 years, or to age 65
- Premiums tax-deductible (both inside and outside super)
- Inside super: limited to 2-year benefit period since October 2021
- Outside super: to age 65 benefit period available

Private Health Insurance:
- Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS): additional 1-1.5% tax if no private
  hospital cover and income over $93,000 single / $186,000 family
- Lifetime Health Cover (LHC): 2% loading for each year over 30
  without private hospital cover (max 70% loading)
- Private Health Insurance Rebate: government rebate on premiums
  Depends on age and income tier (up to 33.8% for under-65s)

Insurance Through Super vs Personal:
Advantages of super:
- Tax-effective: premiums from pre-tax money
- Automatic acceptance for default cover
- Doesn't affect personal cash flow

Disadvantages of super:
- Erodes retirement savings
- Usually "any occupation" TPD (harder to claim)
- Income protection limited to 2-year benefit period
- Less flexibility in policy features

Underinsurance in Australia:
- Many Australians are significantly underinsured
- Average life cover through super is approximately $200,000 which is
  often inadequate to cover mortgage + family living costs
- Most employer super funds include default life and TPD cover but
  income protection is less common in default cover
- Risk: default cover erodes without awareness if premiums rise or
  balance drops

Recommended approach:
- Consider a mix: basic cover through super, top-up outside super
- Review annually, especially after life events (marriage, children, mortgage)
